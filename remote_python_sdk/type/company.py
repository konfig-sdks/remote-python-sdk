    # The company status determines what a company is allowed to do: - `pending`: The company has been created and the company owner invited. Remote is waiting for the company owner to complete onboarding. - `review`: The company is under review. In rare occasions, a company may not automatically get created in `active` status because Remote needs to   manually review the company that was created. The company will become `active` once the review is completed and no further action is necessary   through the Remote API. - `active`: The company owner has completed onboarding and the company is ready to employ. - `archived`: The company is no longer active on the Remote platform and no changes can be made to the company.
